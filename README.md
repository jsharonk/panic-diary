panic diary: web app that turns your emotions into music /
a panic attack plays out its paralyzing sameness every time you have one / 
a conventional diary that logs words stares back at you blankly / 
to play out your panic attack differently / 
go ahead and click on your feeling(s) / 
just one? / 
feeling all ! / 
i tend to feel a cocktail of several at least /
different combinations /
different timing /
play it out /
